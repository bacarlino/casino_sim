The Python used in this code is based on the book Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design by Steven F. Lott.
The book does not give you exact code examples to copy, but instead guides you towards figuring the code out for yourself. 
With several exceptions, most of the code used to create the application was written by me with guidance from the book - not copied.
